-- Changes from the original:
--   - Removed the HTTP server: `HTTPServer`, `http.server` and the routing helpers, which call `astra_internal__start_server`, and `http.middleware`.
--   - Removed the `---@class` annotations that described only the server (`callback`, `HTTPRouteConfiguration`, `HTTPRoute`, `IPAddress`, `HTTPMultipart*`, `HTTPServerRequest`, `HTTPServerResponse`, `Cookie`).
--   - Removed `execute_websocket` from the `HTTPClientRequest` annotations, and the WebSocket annotations (`CloseFrame`, `WebSocketMessageType`, `WebSocketMessage`, `WebSocket`, `wscallback`): the WebSocket client is not taken.
--   - The rest of the client (`http.request`, `http.status_codes`) is unchanged.
